    <h1>Hi my name is Thomas</h1>
    <h2>I love unique video games!</h2>
    <h3>What do I mean by that?</h3>
    <p>A unique game to me is something that has a personality or energy that it uncommon.
        Something you're unlikly to see again in story, characters, or game mechanics.
        There's nothing more boring to me (in a game) than doing something I feel like
        I've done 1000 times before in other games.
